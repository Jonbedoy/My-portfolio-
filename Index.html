                <p>Incorporating consistent user research and limiting repetitiveness 
                    has given my work a competitive edge. My goal is to create organized control groups, which 
                consist of relative backgrounds, experience, and expectations. Identifying common issues among
                my users has helped me expand my methods of user research and focus on a path going forward.

                    Interface Design. Through complex research and analyzation, I am able to appeal to the needs of
                my user while keeping things easy to navigate. It is important to create an inference for my user
            that is backed up with research to provide the best design possible.  </p>

                <p>Quality Web Development starts with understanding where I need to begin and planning 
                    out the design. I break down codes by identifying what components need to be input. 
                    Through web design I identify where the HTML and CSS belong accordingly
                     to ensure qaulity results.

        <p>
        This bloom project was a great experience to learn to identify users needs with thorough questions and interviews 
        identifying what the pain points were. With the issues being addressed we approached this by creating innovative
        solutions such as adding the feature to take a picture of your plant to see what issues it may have. I worked with 
         my group to be able what other features we may add as well what the user really needs help with.

           <p>The Government Redesign was a great way to observe how to create changes in a website or simplify it.
            I worked with my group to identify what people have been struggling with when navigating through the 
            website and used that to define how we would like to design our website. Through this we were able
            to make the header and search bar easier to navigate through.

           <p>My group really enjoyed redesigning this and had a lot of learning opportunities as we developed the site.
            We realized that the website was not going to be for people looking to find
            a place to sleep. We realized this was going to be created for people who would like to volunteer.
            This shifted our whole project and really taught us how to read carefully what our task is 
            being asked and to address the issue that the user is struggling with.
